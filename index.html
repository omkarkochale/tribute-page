            <h2>The Revolutionary Man</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Elon Reeve Musk</b>
                Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa),
                South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX,
                maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in,
                as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.
                <b>PayPal and SpaceX</b>
                Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario,
                and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s
                degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University
                in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential
                to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business
                directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million,
                and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized
                in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
                <b>Tesla</b>
                Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major
                funders of Tesla Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard
                and Marc Tarpenning. In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km)
                on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting,
                it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s
                initial public offering raised about $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was 
                acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury 
                SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017 and became 
                the best-selling electric car of all time.
                Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an 
                alternate faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 
                miles (560 km) between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, 
                nearly the speed of sound. Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing 
                every two minutes on average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. 
                However, he stated, between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development.
